# Load PLANNING Guidelines

This command ensures the AI assistant always loads and applies the architectural and style guidance contained in **PLANNING.md**.

## Target File: PLANNING.md

## Usage Scenario
Execute this command at the very beginning of every new conversation or coding session, **before** any design or implementation work begins.

## Process

1. **Read PLANNING.md**
   - Load the entire file.
   - Extract key information on architecture, directory structure, naming conventions, technology stack, and coding standards.

2. **Internalise & Summarise**
   - Produce a concise internal summary highlighting mandatory rules and recommended patterns.
   - Keep this summary available for quick reference during the session.

3. **Conform Decisions**
   - Verify every architectural, naming, and structural decision against the PLANNING.md rules.
   - If an action conflicts with PLANNING.md, stop and adjust the plan or ask for clarification.

4. **Reference When Needed**
   - When proposing code changes or answering questions, explicitly mention which PLANNING.md rule influenced the decision.

5. **Update Awareness**
   - If PLANNING.md changes mid-session, re-run this command to refresh context.

## Checklist (Pass/Fail)
- [ ] PLANNING.md was fully read.
