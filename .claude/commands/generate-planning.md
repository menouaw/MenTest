# Create PLANNING Document

## Output File: PLANNING.md

Generate or overhaul the **PLANNING.md** file so it becomes the single source of truth for project architecture, conventions, and constraints. This document guides every future feature and refactor.

---

## Research Process

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Survey existing directory layout and module boundaries.
   - Identify recurring architectural patterns (e.g., hexagonal, MVC).
   - Catalogue shared utilities, common libraries, and infra (virtual-env, CI scripts).

2. **External Inspiration**
   - Explore reference projects (see `examples/` folder) for proven structures.
   - Gather best-practice links (official docs, blog posts).

3. **Stakeholder Input** (when available)
   - Clarify technology stack decisions (framework versions, database, CI tooling).
   - Capture non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability).

## PLANNING.md Must Contain

- **Project Vision & Goals** – Succinct description of the product and value prop.
- **High-Level Architecture** – Component diagram & narrative; include Mermaid where helpful.
- **Directory / Module Structure** – Mapping of folders to domains/responsibilities.
- **Naming Conventions** – Files, classes, variables, tests.
- **Technology Stack & Versions** – Languages, frameworks, linters, formatters.
- **Coding Standards & Style** – PEP8, Black, typing, docstring style.
- **Testing Strategy** – Unit, integration, e2e, coverage targets.
- **CI / CD Pipeline Overview** – Key steps, tooling.
- **Environment Management** – `python_dotenv`, env var guidelines.
- **Contribution Guide** – Branch strategy, commit message style.
- **Refactor / Deprecation Policy** – How to remove or change code safely.

## Implementation Blueprint

1. Draft outline covering the above mandatory sections.
2. Populate each section with concise yet complete details gathered during research.
3. Add diagrams (Mermaid) where architecture needs visualisation.
4. Ensure links to reference docs and example code snippets.
5. Revise for clarity, remove redundancy, ensure ≤ 500 lines.

## Validation Gates (Executable)
```bash
# Style / Lint
markdownlint PLANNING.md
```

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All mandatory sections present.
- [ ] Consistent formatting & heading hierarchy.
- [ ] References and URLs verified.
- [ ] File length ≤ 500 lines.
- [ ] Lint passes (`markdownlint`).
- [ ] Clear enough for a mid-level developer to follow.

> **Goal**: Equip future contributors with immediate architectural context and rules ensuring long-term consistency.
